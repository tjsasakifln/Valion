## üéØ The Strategic Opportunity: A Global Compliance Engine

Property valuation is a critical function, yet it is highly fragmented by jurisdiction. Valion solves this challenge head-on, offering a multinational institution the ability to unify its valuation operations, drastically reducing operational complexity, costs, and regulatory risk.

The global PropTech market is projected to grow from ~$40 billion in 2024 to $88 billion by 2032, and the adoption of Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) is being driven by regulatory mandates, especially in Europe.

**Valion is not just another AVM; it is a strategic risk management and compliance solution on a global scale.**
